## Brief Introduction
An advanced version based on the fundamental edition of the snakegame.
Completed by DZX, QJC and XKY in Summer, 2024. 
Supported by PDCurses and SFML.
Everything available on [Our GitHub](https://github.com/PasserbyZzz/SnakegamePlus).

Players can choose from three kinds of mode in our game: *Single Player*, *Two Players* and *Entertainment*.
Explanations are as follows.

### Part I. Single Player mode
In this mode, you'll control a green and white snake by `W A S D` or `‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí`. Just follow the rules of the classic snakegame except for 3 aspects:

1. **Obstacles:** `White square` symbolize a obstacle. Please avoid crashing into them, or the game will over. However, you can press `Y` or `y`, which make you deathless temporarily when you're about to crash into the obstacle. 
2. **Portal Gates:** `O` which appears in pairs stands for a portal gate. When you travel into one of them, you'll come out from another in the same color. 
3. **Blue Food:** `#` in white is just a simple food, while `#` in blue can provide you with a transitory acceleration. 

### Part II. Two Players mode
In this mode, P1 will control a blue and white snake, while P2 a red and white snake. Everything is the same with *Single Player mode* except that:
1.  `Y` and `y` are disabled. 
2.  Player who scores more points in the limited time will win. 
3.  Player who crashed into a obstacle or the wall immediately loses. 
4.  A tie will be reached when one snake's head crashes into the other's.

### Part III. Entertainment mode
In this mode, you'll see a large amount of food with different values.
 - White food: 1 point
 - Blue: 2 points
 - Red: 3 points
 - Yellow: 5 points
  
  Obstacles, `Y` and `y` are reserved,  while portal gates are banned. Try to score as many as points as you can within the limited time.
